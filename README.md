# fundMyTeacher

This web app makes it easier for school alumni or others to donate to their school, teacher or classroom. FundMyTeacher app can be used by verified teachers to list needed class supplies that can be funded by alumnis, parents or other donors. 

The app was built using the Django model view controller (MVC) architecture. I used the Django forms to build the front end and PostgreSQL database to store information about schools, teachers, and supply requirements.
